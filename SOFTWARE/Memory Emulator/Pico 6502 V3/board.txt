## ####################
## search for libraries
## ####################

# only search for 'libs in libs' in each library root (or library \src folder for vs libs)
# the default is 'all', which matches the functionality of the current arduino ide.
# switch off looking for 'libraries in libraries' by setting this property to 'none' (recommended !!)

# deep search over project source?
# the default is all which matches the arduino ide

# search the temp/project_name.cpp only if it has changed (or a dependency or board option has changed)

#  this property defaults to false to match the current Arduino ide

vm.preproc.sketch.cpp-datetime-use-cache=true


# deep search uses file of original temp/projet_name.cpp, instead of the one in the build folder that is always recreated. this voids the project_name.cpp from being deep searched always, regardless of normal cache determination.
# the default is false, less efficient but matches the current Arduino ide.

# ####################
# prototype generation
# ####################

# use previous gcc results, if available and the sketch ino code has not changed
# default is true, the most efficient setting.
